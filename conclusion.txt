1) The most challenging part of this assignment was getting all of the steps in the correct order. For example, I created the new bracnh but forgot to move to that branch afterward, so did the entire assignment on my main branch on accident. I had to delete all files and re-do them on the correct branch. 
2) I learned the necessary steps to commit changes and what they mean. First you have to add all changes to the stage, which you can do either with git add <filename> or with git add . (if you want to stage everything). Then you have to commit those changes using git commit, then push them onto github using git push. All of these steps must be done in that order.
